Todo:
	fix the add card to deck:
		-currently adds the whole card as is and we need to create a new instance of it
		-it doesn't update the master card that is in a new deck

	add the feature remove card from deck:
		-currently there is no way in the menu to do that
		-the function probably has errors in the way it acesses the dictionary

	add a column that showns in which deck the card is
		-currently we dont print that information
		
	design and create the graphical user interface
		-currently only the terminal works and with bugs
